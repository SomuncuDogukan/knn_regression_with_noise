# KNN Regression with Noise

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to perform regression on synthetic data. The target values are based on a sine function. Noise is added to simulate real-world data. Two weight settings are tested: 'uniform' and 'distance'.

## What it does

- Generates 1D feature data
- Calculates target values using sin(x)
- Adds noise to every 5th sample
- Fits two KNN regression models with different weight options
- Plots the predictions for comparison using subplots
